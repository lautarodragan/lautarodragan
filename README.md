My name's Lautaro Dragan. I'm a professional JavaScript and TypeScript developer. I've been creating applications professionally since 2009, and for fun and learning for 5 years before that. 

My teams and I have deployed code used by tens of millions of humans and I've learned a few things in the process. 

I've written applications large and small, backend, frontend and Android, in 7 different programming languages. I've been a Tech Lead, Agile Coach and Scrum Master. 

ðŸŒ± The main things I'm continuously learning about are *functional programming* and *blockchains*, Bitcoin and Ethereum mainly. I've also grown an interest in cryptography.

ðŸ“– I write about JavaScript, software architecture, crypto-currencies an more: https://tarokun.io.

ðŸ’ª I'm looking for my new awesome challenge. If you're working on something great, [let's talk](https://linkedin.com/in/lautarodragan)!
