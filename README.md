### Hey, I'm Taro ðŸ‘‹
_pronouns: they/them_

I'm a professional JavaScript and TypeScript developer. I've been creating large-scale applications since 2009, and for fun and learning since 2003. 

My teams and I have deployed code used by tens of millions of humans and I've learned a few things in the process. 

Very short summary of my experience:
- I've worked for Amazon, Electronic Arts and other large companies.
- I've also worked for many small and medium start-ups.
- I've written applications large and small, backend, frontend and Android, in 7 different programming languages. 
- I've been a Tech Lead, Agile Coach and Scrum Master. 
- 10 years of experience with NodeJS
- 7 years of experience with ReactJS
- 7 years of experience with TypeScript
